## Overview

**HashPrep** is an intelligent dataset debugging and preparation platform that acts as a comprehensive pre-training quality assurance tool for machine learning projects. Think of it as **"Pandas Profiling + ESLint + AutoML"** specifically designed for ML datasets.

The platform catches critical dataset issues before they derail your ML pipeline, automatically suggests fixes, and generates production-ready cleaning code - saving hours of manual data debugging and preparation work.

## Features

Key features include:

- **Intelligent Profiling**: Detect missing values, skewed distributions, outliers, and data type inconsistencies.
- **ML-Specific Checks**: Identify data leakage, dataset drift, class imbalance, and high-cardinality features.
- **Automated Preparation**: Get context-aware suggestions for encoding, imputation, scaling, and transformations.
- **Rich Reporting**: Generate interactive dashboards, statistical summaries, and exportable reports for collaboration.
- **Production-Ready Pipelines**: Automatically create reproducible cleaning and preprocessing code that integrates seamlessly with ML workflows.

HashPrep turns data debugging into a guided, automated process - saving time, improving model reliability, and standardizing best practices across teams.
